           <h2>Game Creation Idea</h2>
           <p>Jullie Cach/August 2,2021</p>
           <p>
            On Friday we were given a task to create ideas of a game for a specific topic we wanted to bring 
            importance to. In my group, we thought of a game based on the topic of climate change and how it 
            affects the environment. The game would let players experience the effects of climate change in 
            different places of the world and how their actions matter. We hoped through this game it would 
            raise awareness to the people and for them to take accountability of their own actions and educate 
            others around them. We named our game <strong>OneCRW</strong> and even created a poster for it. 
            <br>

            </p>
            
            <p>
            <strong>How the game works and its features:</strong>
            <dl><ul>
            <dt><li>In form of a mobile app and web browser</li></dt>
            <dt>Multiplayer</dt> 
            <dt><li>One can make their own decision</li></dt>
                 <dd><li>Ex: Whether the player decides to throw their trash in the trash can, recycle bin, or on the floor.</li></dd>
            <dt><li>Missions and Quests</li></dt>
                 <dd><li>Completing quests or missions help earn rewards/scores</li></dd>
                 <dd><li>Ex: not littering, preventing someone from pouring harmful chemicals into the oceans, not throwing 
            garbage in the wrong place. Because these are good actions, they’ll notice how their environment 
            slowly improves just by their simple actions.</li></dd>
                 <dd><li>If the player were to choose to litter or contribute to climate change, the player loses points and 
            notices how their actions reflect negatively in the environment they are in. This connects back to 
            players making their own choices.</li></dd>
            <dt><li>Different servers/world (locations)</li></dt>
                 <dd><li>Similarly to minecraft (inspo), it’ll have different servers which connect to different worlds/locations. 
            Servers can be created for friends to play with or for other players to explore how other environments are.</li></dd>
                 <dd><li>The locations and how they are impacted now will be simulated in the game as the game would have maps of 
            the world having our 7 continents to let the player choose where they want to reside in.</li></dd>
            <strong>Example of how the map may look like</strong>
            <br>
            <img src="world_map.jpeg">
            <br>
            Continuation 
                <dd><li>Ex: CA is known for having wildfires. If they were to live in California, they would experience the effects 
            of the wildfires. Like a simulation of real events that happened because of climate change.</li></dd>
            <dt><li>Choosing their own character</li></dt>
                <dd><li>Each player will have the opportunity to choose how to build their character, their name, where they’ll want 
            to live, and how the want they want their home to look like.</li></dd> 
           </dl></ul>
            
            I think this game would be a great game to educate people about climate change, the effects, and how our actions affect it. Hope you enjoyed and liked the idea!

           <h3>My Favorite HTML Tutorial</h3>
           <p>Jullie Cach/July 27, 2021</p>
           <p>
               Below is a tutorial about how floats and clears work. In the tutorial it shows examples of 
               how to change the image direction and have the text wrap around the image. Also how to shift
               text around either below or side to side. Through color blocks, they show more into depth 
               about how float works when shifted to the right or left and about clear. I chose this
               video because it sounded very intriguing to me but as well because after watching it, 
               it gave me a basic understanding about different layouts that can be applied to my website that can be used in the near future!

           <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
           <p>Jullie Cach/July 22, 2021</p>
           <p>
            Thinking more in depth about machine learning and my encounters with it is very interesting. 
            For anyone who has spotify, you may notice that spotify always recommends new music based on 
            the artists and songs you have listened to. Either it pops up on your screen saying “because 
            you listen to these artists, here are some songs for you.” Or on your playlists, at the bottom, 
            it recommends songs to you based on that specific playlist or overall to what you listen to most. 
            I don’t mind the suggestions because sometimes I do like the songs but usually when I’m 
            recommended the songs, they are not always my cup of tea. But usually all my recommendations 
            only stick to one genre. For example if I only listened to jazz, it would only recommend jazz 
            music. Because of this it’s sometimes hard to venture off to different genres because I don’t 
            know where to start. There aren’t really as many recommendations towards other genres as I would 
            like. I would say that’s just one down side about it because it assumes that I only listen to one
            genre.  But inorder to fix that, I would have to listen to other songs from genres I want for it 
            to start recommending more songs besides the ones I usually listen to.

           <h5>The Wow in Cryptography</h5>
           <p>Jullie Cach/July 21, 2021</p>
           <p>
            After learning more about cryptography, it felt like a whole new world opened for me.
            I thought to myself if I kept learning more about cryptography, just like about all the 
            amazing women we read and heard about, I can possibly make a difference. Not to 
            mention it would be a nice way to communicate with others when I don’t want anyone to 
            know what I am talking about. 
            </p>
            
            <h6>Is It Used For Good or Bad?</h6>
            <p>
            Cryptography can be used in a <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>negative</strong> ways. 
            For example, I want to send a secret message without anyone knowing to my friend so 
            I encrypt it and send the message to her. I want to tell her that if she wants to buy 
            ice cream from the person on the corner of the street from where she lives, she shouldn’t 
            because the person doesn’t wash their hands and sometimes there are things found in the 
            ice cream. In this case I would be using cryptography in a positive way because I’m giving 
            her a heads up on the person for her not to get sick. Just like in times of war, cryptography 
            can be used to let the people know about something that can cause damage and with the heads up, 
            they can help prevent anything bad from happening. On the contrary, if I told my friend that 
            the ice cream right on her corner is amazing and should try it knowing these bad things, 
            I would be using cryptography in a negative way as I’m giving false info and leading my 
            friend to getting sick. Similarly during times of war, secret messages can be sent but can 
            give false information and lead to damage being done.
