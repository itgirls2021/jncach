           <h2>My Favorite HTML Tutorial</h2>

               Below is a tutorial about how floats and clears work. In the tutorial it shows examples of 
               how to change the image direction and have the text wrap around the image. Also how to shift
               text around either below or side to side. Through color blocks, they show more into depth 
               about how float works when shifted to the right or left and about clear. I chose this
               video because it sounded very intriguing to me but as well because after watching it, 
               it gave me a basic understanding about different layouts that can be applied to my website that can be used in the near future!

           <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
           <p>Jullie Cach/July 22, 2021</p>
           <p>
            Thinking more in depth about machine learning and my encounters with it is very interesting. 
            For anyone who has spotify, you may notice that spotify always recommends new music based on 
            the artists and songs you have listened to. Either it pops up on your screen saying “because 
            you listen to these artists, here are some songs for you.” Or on your playlists, at the bottom, 
            it recommends songs to you based on that specific playlist or overall to what you listen to most. 
            I don’t mind the suggestions because sometimes I do like the songs but usually when I’m 
            recommended the songs, they are not always my cup of tea. But usually all my recommendations 
            only stick to one genre. For example if I only listened to jazz, it would only recommend jazz 
            music. Because of this it’s sometimes hard to venture off to different genres because I don’t 
            know where to start. There aren’t really as many recommendations towards other genres as I would 
            like. I would say that’s just one down side about it because it assumes that I only listen to one
            genre.  But inorder to fix that, I would have to listen to other songs from genres I want for it 
            to start recommending more songs besides the ones I usually listen to.

           <h4>The Wow in Cryptography</h4>
           <p>Jullie Cach/July 21, 2021</p>
           <p>
            After learning more about cryptography, it felt like a whole new world opened for me.
            I thought to myself if I kept learning more about cryptography, just like about all the 
            amazing women we read and heard about, I can possibly make a difference. Not to 
            mention it would be a nice way to communicate with others when I don’t want anyone to 
            know what I am talking about. 
            </p>
            
            <h5>Is It Used For Good or Bad?</h5>
            <p>
            Cryptography can be used in a <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>negative</strong> ways. 
            For example, I want to send a secret message without anyone knowing to my friend so 
            I encrypt it and send the message to her. I want to tell her that if she wants to buy 
            ice cream from the person on the corner of the street from where she lives, she shouldn’t 
            because the person doesn’t wash their hands and sometimes there are things found in the 
            ice cream. In this case I would be using cryptography in a positive way because I’m giving 
            her a heads up on the person for her not to get sick. Just like in times of war, cryptography 
            can be used to let the people know about something that can cause damage and with the heads up, 
            they can help prevent anything bad from happening. On the contrary, if I told my friend that 
            the ice cream right on her corner is amazing and should try it knowing these bad things, 
            I would be using cryptography in a negative way as I’m giving false info and leading my 
            friend to getting sick. Similarly during times of war, secret messages can be sent but can 
            give false information and lead to damage being done.
