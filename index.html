            <h1>Jullie Cach's Biography</h1>

            <p>
                Hi!! I'm Julissa but everyone calls me Jullie and I'm a rising sophmore (2024) whose from Los Angeles, CA! (I know my name has 2 l's but for as long as I've known, that's how its been spelled) 

                Everything now is <strong> all about technology </strong>which influenced my interest in learning more about technology about how it works, made and etc. I was exposed to coding during middle school and it was something I really enjoyed as it sparked my interest to learn more about technology which led me to applying to this program to learn a bit of everything, but as well have fun meeting and making new friends. 
                A lot of people describe me as an intoverted extrovert (if that makes sense) as I'm very loud, outgoing, and chaotic with people I feel comfortable with and know well. Whereas with knew people I'm very quiet and shy but still mingle with everyone.

            <p>
                I usually like to dance, listen to music, sing, watch tv (netflix,youtube,hulu, etc.) and do ceramics. 
            
                I hope you were able to get a small glimpse about me and can't wait to learn more and deepen my knowledge through this course. I look forwarding to meeting, working, and having fun with everyone!!
